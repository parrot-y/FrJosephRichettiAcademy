# 🔧 FIXES APPLIED - October 28, 2025

## Problem
You couldn't see:
1. ✅ The turquoise color (#78D1C5) from school poles
2. ✅ Scroll animations on cards and sections

---

## Root Cause Found

### **Animation Issue:**
The file `disable-scroll-animations-fixed.css` was **killing ALL animations** including AOS!

**Problem lines (102-109):**
```css
.aos-animate {
    animation: none !important;  /* ❌ This killed AOS animations! */
}
```

### **Color Issue:**
CSS files had **old version numbers** (`?v=20241014`), so your browser was using **cached versions** with the old cyan blue color.

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enabled AOS Animations**
**File:** `disable-scroll-animations-fixed.css`

**Changed:**
- ❌ Removed `.aos-animate` from disable rules
- ✅ Added comments explaining AOS is now enabled
- ✅ Changed `scroll-behavior` from `auto` to `smooth`

**Before:**
```css
.aos-animate {
    animation: none !important;  /* Killed animations */
}
html {
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;  /* No smooth scrolling */
}
```

**After:**
```css
/* .aos-animate is intentionally NOT disabled here */
/* Allow AOS animations to work */
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth !important;  /* Smooth scrolling enabled */
}
```

### 2. **Updated CSS Version Numbers (Cache Busting)**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Still not seeing changes?

1. **Clear browser cache completely:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data

2. **Try incognito/private browsing:**
   - This bypasses all cache

3. **Check console for errors:**
   - Press F12 → Console
   - Look for any red errors

4. **Verify server is running:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8001
   ```

5. **Check AOS loaded:**
   - Console should show: "AOS animations initialized and refreshed"

### Colors still wrong?

- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Check inspector: Right-click button → Inspect
- Look for `background: #78D1C5`

### Animations not triggering?

- Scroll slowly (animations trigger when elements come into view)
- Check console for "AOS initialized" message
- Open `color-test.html` to verify AOS works
