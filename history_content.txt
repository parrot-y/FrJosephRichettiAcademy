HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL
The Italian born Consolata Priest Fr. Joseph Richetti was a missionary per excellence. He was
always with the people and strived to improve their lives by empowering them in all ways. He had
a passion to start a project that would bring positive change in the community. The idea of a
catholic private school was always at the back of his mind as one of the ways that could help the
local community to achieve social, spiritual and moral development. Fr. Joseph Richetti worked
in Karuri parish from 1989 to 1993 when he passed on, God bless his soul.
A DREAM REALIZED
Rev Fr. David Njau joined Karuri Parish in January 2004. The then St. Marks Nursery was running
but not able to sustain itself financially due to low enrolment of pupils. In May 2004, together with
the church leaders, Fr. Njau restructured the Nursery and two teachers were employed. This was
not an easy endeavor. With the fresh beginning, and with great focus, the nursery school became
a great success. By mid- 2005, the parents of the densely populated Karuri parish area requested
that a private catholic school be established so that the nursery school graduates may continue their
primary school education in the same serene environment. They wanted the success of the
restructured nursery to now spread out to primary school level. We remain forever grateful to the
parents who appreciated the great work of the priests, the church leaders, the teachers and the staff
of the nursery and motivated them to reflect about establishing a catholic school.Fr. Njau consulted
the church leaders who pondered on the idea. The challenge was where to get funds for such a
great undertaking.
For the longest journey starts with a single step, a luncheon was held on 1st October 2005. The
function was able to raise slightly over Kshs. one million. A great work was done behind the scenes
by a committee which was appointed by Fr. Njau, it organized the luncheon and also ensured the
actual establishment of the school. With sufficient classrooms which had been built by Fr. Richetti,
the money raised facilitated the purchase of the first school van. May we never forget all the people
of good will who attended that first luncheon and contributed generously. They believed in us to
realize a vision which to some was just a mission impossible. January 2006 remains one of the key
moments of this school as 68 pupils were admitted to class one. The parents showed great
confidence by bringing their children to start off the school. Even with the area having well
established schools, they decided that they would rather be part of the new school. With a great
vision by the school committee, it was seen appropriate that the school be a one stream institution
from the second intake.
The second intake therefore was restricted to 31 pupils. Three more teachers were employed to
cater for the primary section. The second luncheon was held in March 2007 towards the purchasing
of a school bus. Rev Fr. David Njau was transferred in April 2007. He was succeeded by Fr.
Anthony Waithaka who continued with the school development. In March 2008 a luncheon was
held to clear the balance that was there after the purchase of the bus. Rev Fr. Anthony Waithaka
was transferred in July 2012.
Rev Fr. Emmanuel Ngugi Ndung’u joined Karuri parish in July 2012. In September 2012 the
school was registered with a total number of 315 pupils. In December 2013 the construction of a
new block began. This has enabled the school to grow significantly.
Fr. Joseph Richetti has experienced tremendous growth and in 2018 the Competency Based
Curriculum was rolled out. Through the BOM and parents' support, the school was able to have a
smooth transition. Ongoing trainings have since been carried out to ensure the teachers are
equipped and prepared to facilitate learning.
In 2020, just like any other institution, the school was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This
led to the introduction off online classes in the months of July and August which benefitted the
learners.
In September 2020, class 8 and grade 4 learners resumed back to school. This was because the
class 8 was then a candidate class and grade 4 was the pioneer CBC class.
Ongoing classroom construction has been taking place to help accommodate the increase in the
population growth. A lab was also constructed which has aided in the science lessons.
The population of the pupils is 795 with a staff of 70 both the teaching and non-teaching staff.
Extra-curricular and co-curricular activities have been part of learning in the institution. This has
enhanced learners' participation in Music festivals, drama festivals, athletics, and ball games
within the sub-county.
The school has been able to see learners represent Kiambaa sub-county at the Music festivals in
the national level in the year 2018 and 2019.
In January 2023, Fr. Peter Kiguru joined the school as the Director. He continued with the school
projects.
Fr. John Kung’u joined the school in August 2023. He has been instrumental in the day to day
running of the school as well as supporting the ongoing school projects.
With great teamwork from the Director, BOM, Parents and teachers, quality education is being
offered to the learners founded on Christian faith. Part of the school’s mission is the realization of
exploitation of talents and abilities embedded in the motto “right is light” which is in line with the
Competency-Based Curriculum.
The school aims to produce responsible and hardworking citizens and to bring light to the society.
