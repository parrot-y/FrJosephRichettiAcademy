# üè´ How to Add the School Logo

## Quick Steps to Replace the Logo:

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
1. **Save the blue school logo** (the one with "FR. JOSEPH RICHETTI CATHOLIC SCHOOL" and "RIGHT IS LIGHT") 
2. **Name it exactly**: `school-logo.png`
3. **Save it in**: `assets/images/school-logo.png`

### Step 2: Logo Specifications
- **Format**: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- **Size**: 200x200 pixels (or similar square ratio)
- **Background**: Transparent PNG works best
- **File size**: Keep under 100KB for fast loading

### Step 3: Replace the File
1. Navigate to: `assets/images/`
2. Delete the current `school-logo.png` (it's just a placeholder)
3. Add your actual school logo with the same name: `school-logo.png`

### Step 4: Push to GitHub
After adding the logo:
```bash
git add assets/images/school-logo.png
git commit -m "Add official school logo"
git push origin main
```

## üéØ Where the Logo Appears:
- **Header Navigation**: Next to school name
- **Size**: 50px height (automatically scales)
- **Hover Effect**: Slight zoom animation
- **Mobile**: Responsive sizing (35px on mobile)

## üîß If Logo Doesn't Show:
1. **Check file name**: Must be exactly `school-logo.png`
2. **Check location**: Must be in `assets/images/` folder
3. **Check file size**: Large files may not load quickly
4. **Clear browser cache**: Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)

## üì± Logo Display:
- **Desktop**: 50px height, appears next to "Fr. Joseph Richetti Catholic School"
- **Mobile**: 35px height, responsive design
- **Colors**: Works with both light and dark backgrounds
- **Animation**: Subtle hover effects

The logo will appear in the top navigation bar next to the school name once you replace the placeholder file with your actual school logo!
